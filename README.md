System Operation

The project operates by initially using a small amount of electricity from the battery to apply a force to the hydraulic press, which then generates a significantly greater output force. This mechanical energy is converted into electricity and used to power the electrolysis process.

The hydrogen and oxygen produced are fed into the combustion chamber, where they are combusted to produce heat. This heat is then converted back into electricity using the heat-to-energy generator.

The entire system is designed to create a self-sustaining energy cycle, where the output energy surpasses the input energy, enabling continuous operation.
