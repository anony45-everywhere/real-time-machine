## System Operation

The project initiates by using electricity from the battery to apply a force to the hydraulic press, generating significantly greater output force. This mechanical energy converts to electricity, powering the electrolysis process to produce hydrogen and oxygen. 

These gases are combusted in the combustion chamber, generating heat that is converted back into electricity using a heat-to-energy generator, creating a self-sustaining energy cycle.
